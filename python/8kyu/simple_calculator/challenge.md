# simple calculator

## Challenge Description

You are required to create a simple calculator that returns the result of addition, subtraction, multiplication or division of two numbers.

Your function will accept three arguments:

- The first and second argument should be numbers.
- The third argument should represent a sign indicating the operation to perform on these two numbers.

If the variables are not numbers or the sign does not belong to the list above a message "unknown value" must be returned.

# Example:

```
calculator(1, 2, '+') => 3
calculator(1, 2, '$') # result will be "unknown value"

```

Good luck!
